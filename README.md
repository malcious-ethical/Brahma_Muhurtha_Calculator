# Brahma_Muhurtha_Calculator
Brahma Muhurtha Calculator using Python!
Brahma muhurtha is a time period around 1 hour and 36 minutes before sunrise(ends 48 minutes before sunrise) that is considered auspicious in many Indian spiritual systems. The phrase "Brahma muhurtha" is derived from two Sanskrit words: "Brahma" (the ultimate reality or absolute) and "muhurtha" (a period of time or a moment).  The environment is considered to be clean and calm during the Brahma muhurtha, with little disruption from outside sources. This is an excellent time for spiritual practises including meditation, yoga, and pranayama. 
It is considered that the mind is naturally tranquil and receptive at this time, making it simpler to focus and concentrate. The Brahma muhurtha is also regarded a favourable time in various Indian traditions for specific daily tasks such as studying, planning, and reflection. Starting the day with spiritual practises during this time is said to help set a positive tone for the remainder of the day. 
Since, time of sunrise is different, Brahma Muhurtha is also different. So, I created this python program that will calculate it for you!
The datetime module is used in this programme to determine the Brahma Muhurtha time depending on the dawn time given by the user. The Tkinter library was used to develop the GUI, which comprises a label and entry field for the dawn time, a label to display the Brahma Muhurtha time, and a button to start the computation. When you click the button, the calculate_button_clicked function is invoked, which reads the dawn time from the entry field, calculates the Brahma Muhurtha time with the calculate_brahma_muhurtha function, and changes the result label with the computed timings.
